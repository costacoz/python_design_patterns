# Python Design Patterns

All code examples in this repository are written by me for studying and revisiting purposes.

Every code snippet tested for correct execution. 

## Two main principles in design patterns defined by the GOF:

* Program to an interface not an implementation.
* Favor object composition over inheritance.

### Pattern's four essential elements:
* pattern name
* problem (describes when to apply pattern)
* solution
* consequences (results and trade-offs)

### Design problems that design patterns solve:
* Finding appropriate objects
* Determining object granularity
* Specifying object interfaces
* Specifying object implementations
* Putting reuse mechanisms to work
* Relating run-time and compile-time structures
* Designing for Change
